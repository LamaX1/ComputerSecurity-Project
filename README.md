# ComputerSecurity_Project
Project in Computer Security Course that encrypt and decrypt either a file or a folder using Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

## Getting Started

Hi :) 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The provided java program gives you the ability to Encrypt and Decrypt either a file or a folder using AES or DES. The key is already determined in the code.

## HOW TO RUN:

1- Download the zip file and extract the zip, the folder contains:
	-The App file is present in `src,` which contains the code  
	-Readme file
	-And an input file end with `txt`, and the output files `encrypted` , `decrypted`

2- Open ide for java you have and then go to File->Open Project -> select App.java

3- Run the program

4- The Main menu will show up on the console with the options to Encrypt, Decrypt and exit

5- If you select Encrypt/Decrypt option then it will ask you to choose between (1) File (2) Folder

6- The file name is path for both the file/the folder

7- You can take the path for file or folder from C->user->username->document -> project-> security.txt

8- Copy the path
	- Go to the IDE and right click to paste the path
		note: the txt file name you will write it like security.txt

9- choose the algorithm

10- the output file will be in the same input folder
	- the result will be 
		C:\Users\user name\Documents\Project\security.Encrypted OR C:\Users\user name\Documents\Project\security.Decrypted based on your inputs

11-if you choose a wrong option from (1) File (2) Folder
	-the following message will show up “wrong input!!”
